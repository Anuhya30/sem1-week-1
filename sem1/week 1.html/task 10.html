    <h1> H1 heading is used for Main Title</h1>
    The H1 tag is reserved for the main title of your page or document. This should be a concise and descriptive phrase
    that clearly indicates the primary topic. Content here sets the tone for the entire page and should be both
    informative and engaging, often incorporating important keywords for SEO.</p>
    <p>
    <h1>H2 is used for Section Headings</h1>
    H2 tags are used for major section headings within your content. These headings should break up your content into
    logical sections, helping to organize the material for readability. Use H2s for key topics or themes that support
    the H1 title, and make them descriptive enough to give readers a clear idea of what to expect in that section.</p>
    <p>
    <h1>H3 tag is used for Subsections</h1>
    H3 tags serve as subheadings under H2 sections. They help further divide content into more detailed subsections. Use
    H3s to introduce specific points or aspects related to the H2 heading, allowing readers to navigate your content
    easily. This helps to maintain a clear hierarchy and makes your content more skimmable.</p>
    <p>
    <h1>H4 is used for Detailed Points</h1>
    H4 tags are ideal for breaking down complex information introduced in H3 sections. This level of heading can be used
    for lists, examples, or detailed explanations that further elaborate on the topics covered in H3. They help to
    provide depth and clarity, making it easier for readers to digest intricate details.></p>
    <p>
    <h1> H5 tag is used for Minor Sections</h1>
    H5 tags are used for even more granular subdivisions of content. This level is suitable for smaller, yet still
    relevant points that support H4 headings. Use H5 for specific case studies, anecdotal evidence, or additional
    commentary that may not require the same prominence as higher-level headings.</p>
    <p>
    <h1>H6 is used for Footnotes or Fine Details</h1>
    The H6 tag is the least prominent heading level and is used for the smallest sections of content. This can include
    footnotes, citations, or other minor details that may support your main points but donâ€™t warrant significant
    attention. Using H6 helps keep your main content focused while still providing valuable information.
